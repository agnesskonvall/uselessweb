# Button clicker

Do you want a button that can't be clicked? You've come to the right place! The app keeps score of how many times you didn't click the button. Best your friends in how many times you missed the button!

Available on netlify @ uselesswebproject.netlify.app

# Installation

1. Clone repo from GitHub.
2. Get to clicking!

# Code Review

1. `index.html:08` - remember to have your script-tag inside the body (the end of the body-tag).
2. `style.css:29` - don’t forget to use css-variables for your font-sizes to access them easier, if you ever need to change them.
3. `style.css:28` - same thing with the font-family, create a css-variable in the :root-element!
4. `index.html:13` - maybe consider using classes instead of multiple id’s?
5. tip - consider writing some comments in your code to make it easier to understand when reading the code!

overall very very nice and useless ❤️
